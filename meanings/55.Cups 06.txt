A card of the past and of memories, looking back, as - for example - on childhood; happiness, enjoyment, but coming rather from the past; things that have vanished. Another reading reverses this, giving new relations, new knowledge, new environment, and then the children are disporting in an unfamiliar precinct.

The future, renewal, that which will come to pass presently.

Pleasant memories.

Inheritance to fall in quickly.
